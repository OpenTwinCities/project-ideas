# Project Ideas

This repository is a place to aggregate community ideas and hopefully spin them out into full projects. All you need to do is create a new Github issue: [start here https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/project-ideas/issues/new/choose](https://github.com/OpenTwinCities/project-ideas/issues/new/choose). Fill out as much as you can and we'll be in touch.

Also, if you are interested in collaborating on projects, feel free to browse the project listing (issues) to find a project to collaborate on.
